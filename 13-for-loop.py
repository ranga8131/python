# For loop - Execute code for a fixed number of times
#            We can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.,

#1) prints 1 to 10 sequentially:-
#   for x in range(1,11):
#     print(x)

#2) Prints the numbers b/w 1 and 10 with 2 steps [e.g: 1 3 5 7 9]:-
#   for x in range(1,11,2):  
#     print(x)                 

#3) Print the numbers in reverse order:-
#   for x in reversed(range(1,11)):
#     print(x)
#   print("Happy New Year!")  

#4) Print string entries:-
#   credit_card_number = "6577-5233-6768-7563"
#   for x in credit_card_number:
#     print(x)

#5) Simple program with 'continue'  
#   for x in range(1,21):
#     if x == 13:
#       continue        --> The 'continue' skips the number '13' and prints rest
#     else:
#       print(x)

#6) Simple program with 'break'
#   for x in range(1,101):
#      if x == 13:
#         break         --> The 'break' statement stops printing the numbers when x is '13'
#      else:
#         print(x)
